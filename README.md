- 👋 Hi, I’m @aje-development (Andrew, or AJ in short)
- 👀 I’m interested in joining a front end team and growing into a full-stack developer
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on increasing my javascript understanding while also learning the basics of node.js and back-end.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in a software development team as soon as a finish school. 
- 📫 You can reach out to my work email. aje.develop@gmail.com  -- I will also be deploying my personal website soon with further contact methods. I'll keep this updated.

Thank you for reading :) Happy coding.
